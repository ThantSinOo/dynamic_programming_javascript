	<h1>Rob House</h1>
	<h3> The House Robber problem is a classic dynamic programming problem where you are a robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, but adjacent houses have a security system connected, so you cannot rob two adjacent houses. Your goal is to maximize the amount of money you can rob without alerting the security system.</h3>
